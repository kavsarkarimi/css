        <section>
            the section has 30px margin-bottom 
            <p>
                this paragraph has a 50px margin 
            </p>
        </section>
        <p>
            and this paragraph has 50px margin as well
            <br><br>
            <strong>it seems the section margin should be added to the paragraph margin. but it won't. both of them has the margin in the same direction. so their margin will collapse and the bigger will win. means final distance between two paragraphs is 50px</strong>
